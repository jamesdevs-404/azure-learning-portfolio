# üåê Azure Learning Portfolio

This portfolio documents my hands-on Azure projects aligned with the **AZ-900: Microsoft Azure Fundamentals** exam objectives.  
Each project is designed to be **free-tier friendly** while showcasing **core Azure concepts** such as scalability, governance, and cost optimization.

## üìë Project Roadmap

### [Week 1: Static Website on Azure Storage](week1-static-website/README.md)
- Deploy a static HTML website using **Azure Storage Static Website** feature.  
- **Concepts Learned**:  
  - CapEx vs OpEx, Consumption-based model  
  - Scalability & Agility  
  - Storage Accounts & Resource Groups  
- **Business Value**: Serverless hosting with no infrastructure management, cost-efficient, and globally accessible.

---

### [Week 2: Virtual Machine & Networking](week2-vm-networking/README.md)
- Create a Windows/Linux VM in Azure and configure networking (NSGs, Public/Private IP).  
- **Concepts Learned**:  
  - IaaS (Infrastructure as a Service)  
  - Networking basics (VNet, Subnet, NSG)  
  - Availability & Monitoring  
- **Business Value**: Foundation for hosting applications that require full OS control.

---

### [Week 3: Governance & Cost Management](week3-governance-costs/README.md)
- Apply **tags**, explore **Azure Policy**, and use **Cost Management** tools to track spend.  
- **Concepts Learned**:  
  - Resource Organization (RGs, Subscriptions, Management Groups)  
  - Cost Analysis & Budget Alerts  
  - Azure Policy & RBAC basics  
- **Business Value**: Enforces compliance, improves visibility, and optimizes costs at scale.

---

### [Week 4: Serverless with Azure Functions](week4-serverless/README.md)
- Deploy a simple **Azure Function** (HTTP-triggered) to demonstrate serverless compute.  
- **Concepts Learned**:  
  - Serverless / Function-as-a-Service (FaaS)  
  - Event-driven compute & scalability  
  - Consumption-based billing (pay only when code runs)  
- **Business Value**: Enables lightweight, cost-efficient automation and integrations.

---

## üéØ Outcomes
- Gained **hands-on experience** across IaaS, PaaS, and Serverless models.  
- Learned to apply **AZ-900 fundamentals** in real scenarios.  
- Built a portfolio that demonstrates both **technical execution** and **business value**.  

---

üìå Each project includes:
- **README.md** ‚Üí Steps, learnings, and screenshots.  
- **Code/Configs** (where applicable).  
- **Free-tier safe implementations** so they can be replicated without cost.
