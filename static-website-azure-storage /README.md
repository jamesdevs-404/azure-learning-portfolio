# üåê Static Website on Azure Storage

## üìå Project Summary
In this project, I deployed a **static HTML website** using **Azure Blob Storage‚Äôs Static Website feature**.  
This demonstrates how to build a **serverless, scalable, and cost-effective** hosting solution within the **Azure Free Tier**.

---

## üéØ Objectives
- Learn how to create and organize resources with **Resource Groups**.
- Deploy and configure a **Storage Account**.
- Enable and use the **Static Website feature**.
- Upload and serve files (`index.html`, `404.html`) from Azure Blob Storage.
- Verify the site is **live** and analyze costs (Free Tier).

## üõ†Ô∏è Steps Performed

### 1. Created Resource Group
- Name: `rg-azure-portfolio`  
- Purpose: Logical container to manage all resources for this project.

## üìñ AZ-900 Concepts Learned

### Cloud Concepts
- **Agility** ‚Üí Deploy a website in minutes without infrastructure.  
- **Scalability** ‚Üí Storage scales automatically with traffic.  
- **Consumption-based model** ‚Üí Pay only for what you use (Free Tier included).  
- **CapEx vs OpEx** ‚Üí No upfront cost (CapEx), only operational expense (OpEx).  

### Core Services
- **Storage Accounts** ‚Üí Blob Storage as a PaaS service.  
- **Static Website feature** ‚Üí Directly serve web content.  
- **Resource Groups** ‚Üí Governance and resource organization.  

### Governance & Pricing
- Practiced **cost visibility** with Cost Analysis.  
- Validated **free-tier benefits**.

## üíº Business Value
This project shows how organizations can:
- Quickly publish **websites, dashboards, or prototypes** with no servers.  
- Save costs by leveraging **serverless PaaS services**.  
- Apply **good governance practices** (Resource Groups, monitoring, cleanup).

## üßπ Cleanup
After completing the project, I deleted the **Resource Group** to avoid unnecessary charges and practice cost governance.
